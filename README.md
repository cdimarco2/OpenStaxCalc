# OpenStax Calculus 1 Ancillary Materials

As a result of an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) Textbook Transformation Grant, we created a series of guided notes, with curated and specially created videos for use with the [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) [Calculus 1 textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1).

## Homework
We used the low-cost homework system [Edfinity](edfinity.com). Edfinity courses are mapped to specific OER textbooks, and all problems are algorithmic and coded in an open-source problem format. The link to Edfinity's OpenStax Calculus 1 course is [here](https://edfinity.com/products/5c533d7d78811e0e5904234d).
